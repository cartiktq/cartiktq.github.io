    <h2><a href="https://github.com/cartiktq/AcademicAnalytics">Knowledge Graph Exploration</a></h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to find connections between academicians - experts in mltiple disciplines, such as geology, history, law, medicine, mathematics, etc. - represented as nodes on a graph. 
      Each node is a word cloud representation of the academician with the words being sourced from publications, keynote speeches, presentations, and successful grant proposals authored and/or presented by the 
      academician. The connections between the academicians are obtained by a graph traversal algorithm, which prioritizes distinctness, as opposed to similarity between every connected pair of nodes in the path. 
      This precludes the possibility of relating academicians from the same or similar disciplines, (ex: clinicans with biologists, etc.). The publication can be found here
