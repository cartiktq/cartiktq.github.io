  <h1>My Most Recent Projects</h1>
  <div class="scRNA">
    <h2><a href="https://github.com/cartiktq/ML4SingleCellRNA">Single-Cell RNA Analysis</a></h2>
    <div>This codebase is an approximation of a consulting project I did for a biotech startup. The actual codebase is copyright protected. The Python classes
    handle specific steps including;
      <ul>
      <li>extracting single-cell RNA datasets from an open access repository such as GEO,</li>
      <li>performing preprocessing and QC on the extracted data,</li>
      <li>and the use of classical Machine Learning algorithms (implemented in scikit-learn) for biomarker identification, patient stratification, and identification of
     the specialization trajwectories of various cell types, originating from a single common progenitor, and</li>
      <li>visualization of genetic biomarkers, cell development trajectories, and patient strata using the Seaborn package</li>
    </ul>
    Each of these classes can be containerized into Docker (some of the container code is here) and invoked sequentially using an orchestrator such as Kubernetes or 
    a workflow implemented with Flyte. Actually, my work for the startup involved developing the Flyte workflow to execute this sequence of actions and deploying it on 
    an AWS Fargate cluster

  <div class="KnowledgeGraphExploration-Java">
    <h2><a href="https://github.com/cartiktq/AcademicAnalytics">Knowledge Graph Exploration</a></h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to find connections between academicians - experts in mltiple disciplines, such as geology, history, law, medicine, mathematics, etc. - represented as nodes on a graph. 
      Each node is a word cloud representation of the academician with the words being sourced from publications, keynote speeches, presentations, and successful grant proposals authored and/or presented by the 
      academician. The connections between the academicians are obtained by a graph traversal algorithm, which prioritizes distinctness, as opposed to similarity between every connected pair of nodes in the path. 
      This precludes the possibility of relating academicians from the same or similar disciplines, (ex: clinicans with biologists, etc.). The publication can be found here
      (https://europepmc.org/article/med/26262370)
